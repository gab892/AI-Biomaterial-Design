# AI-Powered Biomaterial Design for Tissue Engineering

## What is this project about?
This project uses AI to design and optimize biomaterials for tissue engineering. It predicts the properties of new materials and suggests the best compositions for tissues like bone, cartilage, and skin.

## How to use this repository
1. Download the files by clicking the green **Code** button and selecting **Download ZIP**.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `biomaterial_analysis.ipynb` to see the analysis and results.
3. The dataset used is in the `data` folder.

## Results
- The AI model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2946.
- A scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted biomaterial properties is included in the notebook.

## Future Work
- Collect more data to improve the model.
- Test the system with real-world biomaterials.
