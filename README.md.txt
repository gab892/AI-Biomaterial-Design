# AI-Powered Biomaterial Design for Tissue Engineering

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI system to design and optimize novel biomaterials for tissue engineering applications. The system analyzes biomaterial data, predicts properties of new materials, and suggests optimal compositions for specific tissue types (e.g., bone, cartilage, skin).
